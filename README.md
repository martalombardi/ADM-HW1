## Script descriptions
Below is a detailed explanation of the repository contents:
- **scripts.py**: This file contains the Python code for the exercises listed in **Problem 1** and **Problem 2** of the homework. Each exercise is accompanied by the following:
  - **Title**: The name of the exercise.
  - **Solution**: My best solution for the exercise, optimized based on multiple attempts.
  - **Relevant comments**: Important explanations about the logic and functionality of the code.
  
  The exercises are presented in the same order as the homework tasks (Problem 1 followed by Problem 2).

- **stamps.pdf**: A PDF file containing screenshots of all my submissions to HackerRank for each exercise. This includes both correct and incorrect attempts, ensuring transparency and verifying the correctness of the final submissions. Each exercise was solved until at least one correct submission was achieved.

## Purpose
This repository aims to showcase the process and effort invested in solving the given problems. The scripts included represent the most optimized solutions I developed after multiple submissions.
